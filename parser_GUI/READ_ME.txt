This is a parser implementeed with a Graphical User Interface using Python, Regex, treelib, and tkinter library.
The user enters lines of code and the program tokenizes each line of code using predefined regex rules. 
The tokens are displayed on a output box. These tokens are then analyzed and parsed based on preset rules and 
displays the parsed data as text and in tree form.
